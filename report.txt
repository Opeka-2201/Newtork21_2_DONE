At the beginning, we had no idea on how to start. So we took a blank sheet of paper and we drew.
First, it was a simple sketch with iot on a side and subscriber on the other. After we drew the broker in the center and 
we added some elements one by one. This sketch make easier for us to separate the big project in a lot of subproject.
So our implementation is for us the most intuitive: we launch a Broker, when the Broker received a new entrant connection,
it creates a new Client. This Client will treat with Messages so it must be possible for it to Receive and Send some Message.
To know which clients are interested by what, there are some Topic to wich it is possible to subscribe. Let us resume this 
introduction with the list of our principal class.

-Broker : the Broker class initializes all the class variable and accept connection and then delegate the new Client to the Client class.
-Client : the Client class received a socket and divided in two the work: receive packet and send packet.
-ReadderBroker : the ReadderBroker class is responsible of packet reception and packet creation
-SenderBroker : the SenderBroker class have to send packet received or created by the ReaderBroker to interested Client.
-Topic : the Topic class store the Client which are interested to a Topic.
-Message : the Message class is our MQTT toolbox. Used to decode or compose MQTT packet.

On the sketch you see a publish message on the position topic from an IoT to the Broker.
